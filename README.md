## Overview

This project is a demonstration of a clean architecture approach to iOS development, using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), Dependency Injection, Factory Protocols, Coordinators, and Service Classes. The goal is to maintain a modular, testable, and scalable codebase that adheres to SOLID principles.

## Architecture

The project utilizes Clean Architecture, a layered architecture that separates concerns into distinct layers:

- Presentation Layer: Handles the UI and user interactions, primarily using the MVVM pattern.
- Domain Layer: Contains the business logic, including use cases and entities.
- Data Layer: Manages data operations, including API calls, database access, and other data sources.

Key components used in the project:

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates the business logic from the UI, making the code more modular and testable.
- Dependency Injection: Reduces coupling between components by injecting dependencies, often via initializers or factory protocols.
- Factory Protocols: Provides a way to create instances of components, promoting loose coupling and testability.
- Coordinator Pattern: Manages the navigation flow and decouples view controllers from navigation logic.
- Service Classes: Responsible for handling data retrieval and persistence, including networking and data storage.

## Features

- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Decoupled components using Dependency Injection and Factory Protocols.
- Coordinators to manage app navigation and flow.
- Clean separation of concerns with MVVM architecture.
- Testable and maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 12 or later
- Swift 5 or later
- CocoaPods

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   - Using CocoaPods:
     ```bash
     pod install
     ```
   - Or using Swift Package Manager:
     - Open the project in Xcode.
     - Go to File > Add Packages and add the required dependencies.

3. Open the Project:
   - Open the `.xcworkspace` file if using CocoaPods.
   - Open the `.xcodeproj` file if not using CocoaPods.

4. Build and Run:
   - Select the target device or simulator.
   - Click the Run button in Xcode or press `Cmd + R`.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular and organized structure:

```
├── ProjectName/
│   ├── AppDelegate.swift
│   ├── SceneDelegate.swift
│   ├── Resources/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Views/
│   ├── ViewModels/
│   ├── Coordinators/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Factories/
│   ├── Networking/
│   ├── Utils/
│   └── Tests/
```

### Key Components

- Models: Defines the data structures used throughout the app.
- Views: Contains the UI components, typically in the form of `UIViewControllers` or `SwiftUI Views`.
- ViewModels: Handles the business logic and prepares data for the Views.
- Coordinators: Manages the navigation flow of the application.
- Services: Includes service classes for API calls, data persistence, and other data-related operations.
- Factories: Contains factory protocols and implementations for creating instances of various components.
- Networking: Manages network requests and API interactions.
- Utils: Utility functions, extensions, and helper classes.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies (if any):

- Alamofire: For networking.
- SwiftyJSON: For JSON parsing.
- Swinject: For Dependency Injection.
- RxSwift: For reactive programming (optional).

## Usage

### MVVM with Dependency Injection

- Each `ViewModel` is injected with required services and dependencies.
- Factory protocols are used to create `ViewModel` instances, ensuring dependencies are loosely coupled.

### Coordinators

- Coordinators are used to manage the navigation flow, creating a centralized point for handling screen transitions.

### Service Classes

- Service classes handle all data-related operations, including API requests and local data persistence.

### Factory Protocols

- Factory protocols provide a way to instantiate components, improving testability and modularity.
